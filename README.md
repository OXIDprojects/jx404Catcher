## How to Use

1. Navigate to Shop Setting and click on 404 Calls.

3. For setting a redirect URL enter into the middle column the new URL. The must not contain the protocol and domain (without http(s):// and www.myshop.com/) and the URL must exist as seo URL. To ensure this, open the new URL once in the frontend of the shop.

The 404 errors of the past can't be shown, because logging of 404 calls is running not until the module is activated.
